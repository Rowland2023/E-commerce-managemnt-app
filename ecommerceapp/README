A high-quality **README.md** is the "landing page" of your code. For a Senior Engineer role, it shouldn't just list features; it needs to explain the **architectural decisions** and **business value** you created.

Here is a professional, recruiter-ready README for your project.

# E-Commerce Command Center: Advanced Workflow & BI Suite

## 🚀 Overview

This is not a standard CRUD application. It is a **Production-Grade Workflow System** designed to manage the full lifecycle of e-commerce operations. By moving beyond simple data entry, this system automates complex business logic including financial aggregation, payment matching, and logistics telemetry.

## 🛠️ Key Engineering Highlights

### 1. Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard

Instead of the standard Django admin, I engineered a custom command center using **Chart.js** and **Django's ORM aggregation**.

* **Real-time Telemetry:** Visualizes 7-day rolling revenue and inventory turnover.
* **KPI Signaling:** Color-coded status badges for instant cognitive processing of payment states.

### 2. Automated Financial Logic

To eliminate manual billing errors, the system implements **database-level aggregation**.

* **Dynamic Total Calculation:** `total_due` is automatically calculated from related `OrderItem` and `Product` tables using Django `Sum` and `F` expressions.
* **Smart Payment Workflow:** The payment interface pulls the exact balance due for selected orders, ensuring financial consistency.

### 3. High-Availability Data Architecture

* **PostgreSQL Schema:** Designed for scalability with strict indexing and normalization.
* **Resiliency Layers:** Implemented a **Redis-to-Database failover** strategy for session management to ensure 99.9% uptime.
* **ETL Pipeline:** A custom Python validation script ensures that bulk customer data (ingested via CSV) meets all PII security and format standards before database insertion.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.10+, Django (Custom Admin Implementation)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational Architecture)
* **Frontend:** Django Templates, Chart.js, Tailwind CSS (for custom components)
* **Caching/Session:** Redis (with LocMemCache fallback)
* **Data Handling:** Greate Expectation for ETL validation

## 🚦 Testing & Data Integrity

Following **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** principles:

* **Unit Testing:** Coverage for complex financial calculations.
* **Validation:** Strict Pydantic-style validation on all incoming data streams.
* **Schema Integrity:** Utilizes PostgreSQL constraints to prevent "orphaned" orders or negative stock counts.

## 📈 Dashboard Preview

* **Main Dashboard:** High-level KPIs and Revenue Trends.
* **Order Management:** Automated price calculation and CSV export actions.
* **Shipment Tracking:** Lifecycle tracking from `Pending` to `Delivered`.
